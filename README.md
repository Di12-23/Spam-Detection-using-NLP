MODEL BUILDING :
1 Splitting Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
2 Training a Classifier: Use machine learning algorithm Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to train a classifier on the TF-IDF features.
3 Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,support to ensure its effectiveness.
