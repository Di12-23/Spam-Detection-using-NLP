3. MODEL BUILDING :
     (a)  Splitting Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
     (b)  Training a Classifier: Use machine learning algorithm Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to train a classifier on the TF-IDF features.
     (c)  Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,support to ensure its effectiveness.
